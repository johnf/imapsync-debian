=================================
= Installing imapsync on CentOS = 
=================================

There is one section for Centos 7 and one for Centos 6.

==============
== Centos 7 ==
==============

First install access to the Epel repository via yum:

  yum install epel-release

Then install imapsync and its dependencies:

  yum install imapsync

After installing imapsync, it should be able to work on your system.
A good test that shows also the basic example:

  imapsync

A live test:

  imapsync --testslive
  
Unit tests:

  imapsync --tests

==================================
== Centos 7 and latest imapsync ==
==================================

At the time of this writing (April 2018), the epel repository contains 
imapsync release 1.727, which is not the latest available release.

In order to install the latest imapsync I suggest the following process:

Install the epel imapsync 1.727 release via yum like mentioned above.
It will install many needed packages, Perl itself and Perl modules 
for release 1.727. The latest imapsync needs more Perl modules.

Then:

  yum install perl-App-cpanminus \
 perl-Dist-CheckConflicts \
 perl-HTML-Parser \
 perl-libwww-perl \
 perl-Module-Implementation \
 perl-Module-ScanDeps \
 perl-Package-Stash \
 perl-Package-Stash-XS \
 perl-PAR-Packer \
 perl-Regexp-Common \
 perl-Sys-MemInfo \
 perl-Test-Fatal \
 perl-Test-Mock-Guard \
 perl-Test-Requires \
 perl-Test-NoWarnings \
 perl-Test-Deep \
 perl-Test-Warn \
 perl-Try-Tiny

  wget https://imapsync.lamiral.info/imapsync

  chmod +x imapsync
  ./imapsync --testslive

Now you have the latest imapsync on Centos 7.
