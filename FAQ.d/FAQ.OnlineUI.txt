   Imapsync tips about the online visual user interface
   https://imapsync.lamiral.info/X/
=====================================================================

Questions answered in this FAQ are:

Q. How secure is the online visual user interface /X?

Q. Will I have any issues with browser timing out? What happens
   if the browser connection is closed for whatever reason?


Now the questions again with their answers.

=====================================================================
Q. How secure is the online visual user interface /X?

R0. Well, I don't know if asking the provider whether his online 
   service is secure or not would be of any interest. 
   Let's do it anyway, you'll be the judge.

R1. Some figures

Date of this report: 8 March 2018.
The online imapsync service /X started 9 January 2017 (422 days of service).
In average, /X has 20 users per day lunching 6 different migrations, from
one launch to many many (hundreds).
The total volume /X transferred is 17 TiB in 48000 email imap migrations.

R2. Pros & Cons

The online imapsync service /X runs on https only, with a 
letsencrypt certificate, a certificate overall rated "A" at
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=imapsync.lamiral.info

Because of the https usage, what the users enter in their browser,
the imap logins and passwords, can't be eavesdropped on the network.

Imapsync itself cares about encryption for the imap sessions, 
if possible: It tries SSL first on port 993, then TLS if the 
servers announces TLS, then no encryption. What is done with
an imap server is independent of what is done with the other.

At the date of 8 March 2018, there is no security problem detected 
or reported to me (Gilles LAMIRAL) so far.

As the owner of the service, it could have been 48 000 pairs of 
credentials collected and nearly 17 terabytes of email messages. 
I haven't kept them but I can't prove I haven't. It's just trust, 
like nearly every online service in the universe.

The imap server certificates are not checked (by default) 
because too many  imap servers are crappy configured regarding 
certificates.

This default behavior is chosen like this because users of /X 
wants their emails transferred, instead of not trasferred because
of an incompetent imap server sysadmin. 
Anyway, this part, checking imap ssl/tls certificates, could be 
improved from my side by including well known certificates 
directly in imapsync. 

If the imap servers don't honor ssl nor tls, then logins, passwords 
and everything will go clear text during the imap transfers. 
That's not good at all but what "comforts" me is that if the 
imap servers do only clear text transfer, then it is also true 
for all imap sessions the owner of the accounts encounter, 
imapsync is just one of them.

Last point, who could be sure no cracker cracked the online host and 
currently sniffs the credentials? No one, I'm not sure myself, even 
if I do take  care of that possibility.

=====================================================================
Q. Will I have any issues with browser timing out? What happens
   if the browser connection is closed for whatever reason?

R. It should be ok

When using the /X interface there are three connections. 
One connection is the Browser-WebServer connection, the
two others are the WebServer-ImapServers connections (imapsync stuff).

If the Browser-WebServer connection is timeout (but it shouldn't
because of the log refresh), the imapsync sync might continue
anyway. To see if it continues or not, just do a sync again and the
interface will tell you that a sync is already going on, if the
"Sync!" button is gray/inactive then just reload the page (F5 or
similar), and reenter the credentials.

By the way, on the /X you can try to do several parallel runs on the same
mailbox even if there is no timeout, open a new tab/windows with /X
and start a same sync, it's safe, the /X will say, if any, that there
is already a current sync.

You can stop this sync with the "Abort!" button from any /X
tab/window, even from another browser or place. To doing this with
success, you have to give the same account parameters, same
credentials, or imapsync will ignore the demand.
