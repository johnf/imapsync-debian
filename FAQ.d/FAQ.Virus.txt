Q. My virus scanner claims imapsync.exe is a virus/malware/trojan etc.
   What the hell?

R1. Yes, I found the same. Two antivirus, Baidu and Jiangmin, report that 
   imapsync might have a trojan in it. 
   All others virus scanner say imapsync.exe is ok.
   I've done this test on imapsync.exe release 1.727 on the two following
   meta-virus-scanners:
   https://www.virustotal.com/
   https://www.metadefender.com/

R2. Explanation: 
    It may come from the fact that imapsync checks whether there is a
    new realease available at http://imapsync.lamiral.info/VERSION
    It's explained here:
    https://imapsync.lamiral.info/#NUMBERS

    Any other explanation is welcome!


R3. There is no virus alerts reported for the Perl script imapsync
    itself. The binary imapsync.exe is just a compiled version of
    the script imapsync, with perl interpreter itself and all modules 
    needed by imapsync in order to make imapsync.exe a standalone software.
	
R4. imapsync.exe release 1.836 is reported as totally clean by both
