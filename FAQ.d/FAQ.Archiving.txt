   Imapsync issues and tips about archiving.
============================================

Questions answered in this FAQ are:

Q. Can I archive different accounts on the same destination account,
   each account on a separate folder?

Q. How to move emails from one IMAP folder to another either on the 
  same IMAP server or a different one?
  For example, all messages older than 1 year, move from INBOX to Archive.

Q. Can imapsync be used to maintain a local offline copy of a 
   mailbox from host1, eg for backup purposes, so that if the 
   server fails, then the mailbox could be reinstated,
   ideally without requiring a second IMAP host?

Q. Can I archive different accounts on the same destination account,
   each account on a separate folder?

R. Yes. Use --subfolder2 

--subfolder2 str : Move whole host1 folders hierarchy under the
                   host2 folder str.
                   It is done it by adding two --regextrans2 options before
                   all others. Add --debug to see what's really going on.

Example:

  imapsync ... --user1 foo --subfolder2 foo

  imapsync ... --user1 bar --subfolder2 bar

In case you need a strict sync, add --delete2 --delete2foldersonly "foo"
(or "bar"), il will delete on account2 what is not on account1 but only
in the right place, ie, the subfolder "foo".
  
  imapsync ... --user1 foo --subfolder2 foo --delete2 --delete2foldersonly "foo"

Q. How to move emails from one IMAP folder to another either on the 
  same IMAP server or a different one?

R1. Solution:

  imapsync ... --minage 365 --folder Inbox --f1f2 INBOX=Archive --delete --noexpungeaftereach

Add option --noexpungeaftereach if speed is a concern.
Add option --delete if you want to move messages, instead of just copy/sync them.

R1. No. Imapsync plays with imap servers only.

R2. Imapsync can't but rick-sanders-imap-tools can!
    See https://github.com/andrewnimmo/rick-sanders-imap-tools
    
    Back up and restore IMAP accounts with imapdump.pl and dumptoIMAP.pl
